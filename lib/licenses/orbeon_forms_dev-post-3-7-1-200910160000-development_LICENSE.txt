1. About Orbeon Forms
****************************************

Orbeon Forms is an open source forms solution that handles the
complexity of forms typical of the enterprise or government. It is
delivered to standard web browsers (including Internet Explorer,
Firefox, Safari and Opera) thanks to XForms and Ajax technology, with
no need for client-side software or plugins.

Orbeon Forms allows you to build fully interactive forms with features
that include as-you-type validation, optional and repeated sections,
always up-to-date error summaries, PDF output, full
internationalization, and controls like auto-completion, tabs, dialogs,
trees and menus.
