Weather
=======


This is not a regular Web application but a Web widget. In order to run it, you need to complete the following steps:
 * Create a WAR file
 * Move /WEB-INF/config.xml to /config.xml
 * Delete this /README.txt file (first, finish reading these instructions)
 * Modify the URLs within the <widget-authentication-uri> and <widget-data-sources-uri> elements in WEB-INF/conf.xml (if needed)
 * Create a ZIP file containing all the source files
 * Upload the ZIP file to a web widget container (e.g., uSpace), which supports XFormsDB-based Web widgets
 * Note: Google has closed Google Weather API in 2012 (http://www.programmableweb.com/news/google-weather-api/2012/08/28). Therefore, this Web widget no longer works.
